# Unity-Transmission-Demo
A simple Unity 3D demo to showcase the transmission model.
It aims to practice Unity and C# skills for designing disassembly and assembly systems.
Use the right mouse button and scroll wheel to change the camera view.
Since this is a simple demo, the following features have not been implemented yet:
- [ ] 3D labels for each part of the transmission
- [ ] More modern UI design
- [ ] Sliders to control animation and gear rotation speed
